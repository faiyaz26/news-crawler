Also, they said since everyone knew the story of Shiva, why would anyone buy another book on him?</p><p>&quot;I stopped counting after 20 rejections.&quot;</p><p>That&apos;s when he decided to self-publish. His wife came up with a clever idea to promote it - the first chapter was printed as a booklet and displayed near the cash counters in book stores two weeks before the launch, and customers were encouraged to take away free copies.</p><p>The campaign was so successful that within the first week of launch, Meluha hit the bestseller chart. Readers who had read the first chapter returned to book stores, asking for more.</p><p>The second and the third books in the Shiva trilogy - The Secret of the Nagas and the Oath of the Vayuptras - published in 2011 and 2013 were also huge hits and the trilogy sold more than 2.75 million copies. </p><p>Bollywood director Karan Johar has bought the rights to make a Hindi film on Meluha, and Tripathi has also sold English film rights to an unnamed Hollywood filmmaker.</p><p>The success of the trilogy changed his fortunes - according to reports he was paid a record signing amount of $1m (&#xA3;770,932) for his next series, and huge publicity campaigns have turned his book launches into major events.</p><p>His Ramchandra series, based on the story of Hindu god Ram, was launched in 2015 with The Scion of Ikshvaku.

There can be different interpretations of old stories. The philosophical core remains, the soul remains, but the packaging can be new.&quot;</p><p>And his packaging is delightfully new - his Shiva is a marijuana-smoking Tibetan immigrant who&apos;s more human than god, with weaknesses and failings.</p><p>And Sita is not a meek woman who obediently follows her husband, Lord Ram.

Modern high-rise buildings in England, Scotland and Wales must be fitted with sprinklers, but calls for more to be done to improve safety in older tower blocks increased following major fires in south London in 2009 and in Southampton in 2010. </p><p>Following the disastrous fire at Grenfell Tower in west London this week, which quickly engulfed the 24-storey block, the government has been accused of failing to ensure sprinklers were fitted to older blocks and of failing to update building regulations. </p><p>Ministers have stressed that at this stage, the exact cause of the Grenfell Tower fire is not known, but Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC that following such a high number of deaths: &quot;Clearly something has gone disastrously wrong ... something needs to change&quot;.</p><p>The former Conservative housing minister Mark Prisk told BBC Radio 5live that clearly not enough time had been spent reviewing fire safety in recent years and ministers &quot;need to do more&quot;.</p><p>There has been criticism that warnings were ignored from a coroner&apos;s report in March 2013 following a deadly 2009 fire in south London - at Lakanal House in Southwark. </p><p>Coroner <a href=""http://chcymru.org.uk/uploads/general/LetterToDepartForCommunitieAndLocalGovernmentPursuantToRule43On28March2013.pdf"" class=""story-body__link-external"">Frances Kirkham wrote to then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles</a>, flagging up several areas of concern. </p><p>She did not say sprinklers must be installed in all high-rise blocks but recommended that the government &quot;encourage&quot; housing providers responsible for high rise flats &quot;to consider the retro-fitting of sprinkler systems&quot;.</p><p>She said there was &quot;insufficient clarity&quot; on advice given to high-rise residents about what to do in case of a fire - and recommended the government publish new guidance about how advice to &quot;stay put&quot;

had been issued to councils over fire safety advice and about &quot;encouraging&quot; housing providers to &quot;consider&quot; fitting sprinklers to older blocks, following another coroner&apos;s recommendation.</p><p>On the need to review fire safety building regulations, he said he had &quot;noted&quot; concerns and research had been commissioned which would &quot;feed into a future review&quot; which was expected to result in a new version of regulations to be published in 2016/17. </p><p>No new laws were brought in to require landlords to &quot;retro-fit&quot; older high-rises with sprinklers.</p><h2 class=""story-body__crosshead"">What are the laws on sprinklers?</h2><p>Since 2007 all new tower blocks in England over 30m high must be fitted with sprinklers by law. In Scotland, buildings over 18m high, must be fitted with sprinklers to meet building regulations introduced in 2005. In Wales, all new homes must have sprinklers.</p><h2 class=""story-body__crosshead"">Is it a question of money?</h2><p>Before the coroner&apos;s report, in 2011, the Lib Dem DCLG minister Andrew Stunnell <a href=""https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111130/text/111130w0004.htm"" class=""story-body__link-external"">told MPs</a>: &quot;It is the chief fire and rescue adviser&apos;s view that it would not be economically viable or practical to fit sprinklers to all existing high-rise residential buildings&quot; and it was up to individual landlords to decide if they were needed.</p><p>The British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association (BAFSA), the trade body for the fire sprinkler industry, said retrofitting Grenfell Tower with sprinklers might have cost &#xA3;200,000. This is the figure for installing a sprinkler system but does not include potential maintenance fees or costs associated with the wider redevelopment of a building.</p><p>Costing will of course vary from building to building. After the Shirley Towers fire in 2010, it cost the council &#xA3;1m to install sprinklers in three tower blocks.</p><p>The cost can be high because in blocks made of concrete and steel like Grenfell, the process is difficult and time-consuming. So the focus has been on other measures which would contain a fire to stop it spreading.</p><h2 class=""story-body__crosshead"">Was a building regulations review &quot;sat on&quot;? </h2><p>A review of building regulations relating to fire safety was promised in 2016 but has not yet been published. </p><p>Then housing minister Gavin Barwell - now Theresa May&apos;s chief of staff - <a href=""https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-10-24/debates/7F77570A-C781-4114-BC3D-35A1C5D0562E/BuildingRegulations#contribution-4F447038-240A-4C2C-BA92-3EA4F2662C10"" class=""story-body__link-external"">said part B of the regulations would be reviewed</a> following the Lakanal House fire. </p><p>The DCLG has said it was &quot;simply not true&quot; to suggest ministers had &quot;sat&quot; on the review and work was continuing, after Labour MPs accused the government of kicking the issue &quot;into the long grass&quot;. </p><p>Ronnie King, the Labour chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety said the regulations &quot;badly need updating&quot; and &quot;three successive ministers have not done it&quot;. He said he believed the government viewed the regulations as &quot;red tape&quot; that would place a burden on business.</p><h2 class=""story-body__crosshead"">What other warnings had there been?</h2><p>A report to the Home Office in the early 1990s, by the architect Sam Webb reportedly warned that many buildings did not meet basic standards.</p><p>A<a href=""https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmenvtra/109/10907.htm"" class=""story-body__link-external""> report by the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee published in 2000</a> looked at how fire could spread via external cladding systems.

There are more than 700 tower blocks, ranging from brand new luxury developments to the post-war council-owned buildings seen as a quick fix to cure problems caused by crumbling and unsanitary 19th Century hovels.</p><p>About 8% of Londoners now live in tower blocks. Some flats are bought for millions; others are relatively low-cost social housing rented from a local council at a fraction of the private rate. Grenfell Tower itself was designed in 1967, started in 1972 and finished in 1974.</p><p>Originally built as municipal housing as part of the slum clearances of the 1960s, it had 120 one- and two-bedroom flats over 20 of its 24 storeys, and was renovated in 2016.</p><p>It&apos;s in a neighbourhood ranked among the most deprived 10% in England. </p><p>Just two miles away - or four stops along the Circle/Hammersmith and City line - is 3 Merchant Square, a 21-storey tower that is part of a new development around Paddington Basin. The contemporary block was finished in 2016 and holds 60 apartments over 15 storeys.</p><p>It&apos;s a different world. The penthouse apartment was sold for &#xA3;7.5m. One-bedroom flats are at least &#xA3;1m. </p><p>Surrounded by restaurants and bars, workers and residents can lounge on deckchairs on a newly-built floating park. Lunchtime yoga sessions are held and there&apos;s a luxury fitness club.</p><p>There&apos;s an enormous fountain and a bridge created by renowned designer Thomas Heatherwick, a nursery and winter garden.</p><p>But nice though these peripheries undoubtedly are, they don&apos;t keep people safe from fire. For that, we must have a look at the specifications of the apartments in the tower.</p><figure class=""media-landscape no-caption full-width""> <div class=""image-and-copyright-container""> <span class=""off-screen"">Image copyright</span> <span class=""story-image-copyright"">Getty Images</span> </div> </figure><p>Once you get past the sales brochure description of 3 Merchant Square&apos;s walnut cutlery drawer inserts and integral wine coolers, the adjustable mood lighting and heated bathroom walls, you come to the fire safety details: Every flat has not only ceiling mounted smoke detectors but sprinklers.</p><p>The International Fire Sprinkler Association (IFSA) says that automatic fire sprinkler systems are the single most effective fire protection measure available, and are able to make up for a wide range of other fire protection deficiencies. </p><p>There has never been a multiple loss of life from a fire developing in a building protected by a properly designed, installed and maintained fire sprinkler system. While fire sprinkler systems have been required in new high-rise residential buildings in England since 2007, it is not compulsory to retrofit them into existing buildings. So Grenfell Tower had none.</p><p>Former chief fire officer Ronnie King, honorary secretary of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety and rescue - which had recommended fitting sprinklers to buildings to save lives - said the regulations &quot;badly need updating&quot; and &quot;three successive ministers have not done it&quot;. </p><p>&quot;My own thinking is there was the red tape challenge and they don&apos;t really want to put regulation on to businesses, adding a burden.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s one of those that if you bring in a new regulation, you have got to give three up to get it.&quot;</p><figure class=""media-landscape no-caption full-width""> </figure><p>A <a href=""http://www.bafsa.org.uk/pdfs/publications/1/00000111.pdf"" class=""story-body__link-external"">2012 report by the British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association</a> (BAFSA) concluded that fire sprinklers could be retrofitted with tenants in place at a cost of about &#xA3;1,150 a flat.

It also hides the key that will allow the shop to unscramble the text securely.</p><p>The weakness is that the number itself can be intercepted, and with enough computing power, cracked.</p><p>Quantum cryptography, as it is called, goes one step further, by using the power of quantum science to hide the key. </p><p>As one of the founders of quantum mechanics Werner Heisenberg realised over 90 years ago, any measurement or detection of a quantum system, such as an atom or photon of light, uncontrollably and unpredictably changes the system. </p><p>This quantum uncertainty is the property that allows those engaged in secret communications to know if they are being spied on: the eavesdropper&apos;s efforts would mess up the connection.</p><figure class=""media-landscape has-caption full-width""> <figcaption class=""media-caption""> <span class=""off-screen"">Image caption</span> <span class=""media-caption__text""> Artwork: The two Earth stations are 1,200km apart </span> </figcaption> </figure><p>The idea has been developed since it was first understood in the 1980s. </p><p>Typically, pairs of photons created or born simultaneously like quantum twins will share their quantum properties no matter how long they are separated or how far they have travelled. Reading the photons later, by shopper and shop, leads to the numerical key that can then be used to encrypt a message. Unless the measurements show interference from an eavesdropper.</p><p>A network established in Vienna in 2008 <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7661311.stm"" class=""story-body__link"">successfully used telecommunications fibre optics criss-crossing the city</a> to carry these &quot;entangled photons&quot;, as they are called. But even the clearest of optical fibres looks foggy to light, if it&apos;s long enough. And an ambitious 2,000km link from Beijing to Shanghai launched last year needs repeater hubs every 100km or so - weak points for quantum hackers of the future to target.</p><p>And that, explains Anton Zeilinger, one of the pioneers of the field and creator of the Vienna network, is the reason to communicate via satellite instead. </p><p>&quot;On the ground, through the air, through glass fibres - you cannot go much further than 200km. So a satellite in outer space is the choice if you want to go a really large distance,&quot; he said.</p><p>The point being that in the vacuum of space, there are no atoms, or at least hardly any, to mess up the quantum signal.</p><p>That is what makes the tests with Micius, named after an ancient Chinese philosopher, so significant. They have proved a spaced-based network is possible, as <a href=""http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aan3211"" class=""story-body__link-external"">revealed in the latest edition of the journal Science</a>. </p><h2 class=""story-body__crosshead"">Technical tour de force</h2><p>Not that it is easy. The satellite passes 500km over China for just less than five minutes each day - or rather each night, as bright sunlight would easily swamp the quantum signal. Micius&apos; intricate optics create the all-important photon pairs and fires them down towards telescopes on some of China&apos;s high mountains. </p><p>&quot;When I had the idea of doing this in 2003, many people thought it was a crazy idea,&quot; Jian-Wei Pan told the BBC World Service from his office in the University of Science and Technology of China. &quot;Because it was very challenging already doing the sophisticated quantum optics experiments in a lab - so how can you do a similar experiment at a thousand-kilometre distance and with optical elements moving at a speed of 8km/s?&quot;</p><p>Additional lasers steered the satellite&apos;s optics as it flew over China, keeping them pointed at the base stations. Nevertheless, owing to clouds, dust and atmospheric turbulence, most of the photons created on the satellite failed to reach their target: only one pair of the 10 million photon pairs generated each second actually completed the trip successfully. </p><p>But that was enough to complete the test successfully. It showed that the photons that did arrive preserved the quantum properties needed for quantum crypto-circuits.</p><p>&quot;The Chinese experiment is a quite remarkable technological achievement,&quot; enthused mathematician Artur Ekert in an e-mail to the BBC. It was as a student in quantum information at Oxford University in the 1990s that Ekert proposed the paired-photon approach to cryptography. Relishing the pun, he added wryly &quot;when I proposed the scheme, I did not expect it to be elevated to such heights.&quot;</p><p>Alex Ling from the National University of Singapore is a rival physicist. His first quantum minisatellite blew up shortly after launch in 2014, but he is generous in his praise of the Micius mission: &quot;The experiment is definitely a technical tour de force.</p><p>&quot;We are pretty excited about this development, and hope it heralds a new era in quantum communications capability.&quot; </p><figure class=""media-landscape has-caption full-width""> <figcaption class=""media-caption""> <span class=""off-screen"">Image caption</span> <span class=""media-caption__text""> Jian-Wei Pan is now set to team up with his old PhD supervisor, Anton Zeilinger, who is based in Vienna </span> </figcaption> </figure><p>The next step will be a collaboration between Jian-Wei Pan and his former PhD supervisor, Anton Zeilinger in the University of Vienna - to prove what can be done across a single nation can also be achieved between whole continents, still using Micius.</p><p>&quot;The idea is the satellite flies over China, establishes a secret key with a ground station; then it flies over Austria, it establishes another secret key with that ground station. Then the keys are combined to establish a key between say Vienna and Beijing,&quot; he told the BBC&apos;s Science in Action programme.</p><p>Pan says his team will soon arrive in Vienna to start those tests. </p><p>Meanwhile, Zeilinger is working on Qapital, a quantum network connecting many of the capitals of Europe, Vienna and Bratislava. Existing optic fibres laid alongside data networks but not currently used could make the backbone of this network, Zeilinger believes.</p><p>&quot;A future quantum internet,&quot; he says, &quot;will consist of fibre optic networks on the ground that will be connected to other fibre networks by satellites overhead. I think it will happen.&quot;</p><p>Pan is already planning the details of the satellite constellation that will make this possible.</p><p>The need? Secrecy is the stuff of spy agencies, who have large budgets. But financial institutions which trade billions of dollars internationally day by day also have valuable resources to protect. </p><p>Although some observers are sceptical they would want to pay for a quantum internet, Pan, Zeilinger and the other technologists think the case will be irresistible once one exists.</p> </div></div>",1497550627,,China's quantum satellite in big leap
